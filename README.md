# Gingrich Stocking Line Calculator
This code is used to take an output from FVS and calculate the A line, B line and C line (percent stocking level) used in Gingrich Stocking Charts (Ginrich 1967).
This code also implements and modifies Knapp and Ducey (2018) relative density function
in order to calculate the percent stocking level.
